# Slow Function Demo

This demo attempts to showcase a slow (relatively) JS function which performs heavy CPU bound operations. There is an attempt to also implement the same logic in Python 3+, to demonstrate how slow it can run.

Generate the WASM file by running

```sh
wasm-pack build
```

which generates a npm package in the "pkg" folder.

You can run the example of integrating this package on browser by running

```sh
yarn install
yarn serve
```

The example of using the .wasm file (generated by running the "wasm-pack build" command) needs python 3.x, pip and the wasmer library

```sh
pip install wasmer
python slow_func_using_wasm.py
```
